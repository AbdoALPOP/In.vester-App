Below is an outline for the documentation that you will create.  It follows markdown heading conventions.  That means that "#" is the largest header, and "####" is the smallest.  Here is the link to the application you will be making the descriptions for: https://in.vester.app/.  The application is pretty easy to use and you should easily be able to write descriptions and how-to for each header.  I expect a couple of quality sentences for each header.  Each header should explain what that given option does from a conceptual standpoint, and offer a description of how to get it done in out application.  Thanks for your help!
